Steps to a booted system:

1	The BIOS is executed directly from ROM

2	The BIOS loads the Bootloader into address 0x7C00

3	The Bootloader loads the kernel


Q => What is a bootloader?

A => It is a small program responsible for loading the kernel of an operating system.

When computer boots, it runs in a compatibility mode (real mode), which only gives us access to 1MB of memory, also runs only 16 bits code.

Responsibility of a bootloader is to put us into protected mode, which would give us access to 4GB address space.
and we would be running 32-but code and then executes the kernel.

It uses functions available in the bios to assist itself.


-------------------------------------------------------------------


-	The CPU executes instructions directly from the BIOS's ROM

-	The BIOS generally loads itself into RAM then continues execution from RAM

-	The BIOS will initialize essential hardware

-	The BIOS looks for a bootloader to boot by searching all storage mediums for the boot signature "0x55AA".
511th byte and 512th byte should contain a boot signature.

If it finds that signature, it will load that sector, at address 0x7C00 and will then execute from that address running our bootloader.

A sector is a block of storage.(512 bytes)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The BIOS is a Kernel in its self

-	The BIOS contains routines to assist our bootloader in booting our kernel

-	The BIOS is 16 bit code which means only 16 bit code can execute it properly

-	The BIOS routines are generic and a standard.
