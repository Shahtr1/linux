- ### Data is initially loaded from RAM into the CPU's cache:

  RAM (Random Access Memory) serves as the primary memory for active data and programs. When the CPU needs to work with data, it fetches the data from RAM into its cache, which is a smaller but faster memory located on the CPU chip. The cache is divided into several levels (L1, L2, L3, etc.), with L1 cache being the closest and fastest.

- ### Data is accessed from the cache:

  Once data is in the CPU's cache, it can be accessed much more quickly than if it were in RAM.

- ### Data is moved from the cache to CPU registers:

  The CPU's registers are the fastest and most immediate form of storage on the CPU. Data is transferred from the cache into the CPU registers when the CPU is actively working on specific data or instructions.

- ### How BIOS code runs?

  When the computer starts up, the CPU initially runs code from a ROM (Read-Only Memory) chip, which contains the firmware, such as the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) code.

  The CPU has a hardwired address known as the reset vector, which is the location from which it begins executing instructions during the boot-up process. This reset vector typically points to the initial entry point of the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or other firmware code.

  When the CPU starts executing instructions from the BIOS firmware, it may initially encounter some setup and initialization code that prepares the system for further execution. This code, often called the BIOS initialization routines, may perform tasks like hardware detection and configuration.

  After the initial setup and preparation, the BIOS may then load or jump to the actual entry point or starting point for BIOS code execution, which is the firmware's main entry point. The CPU's IP (Instruction Pointer) register is adjusted to point to this entry point,
  which is also called `Inital Firmware Memory Address` allowing the BIOS to start executing the core functions of the firmware.

  This transition is a part of the BIOS's control over the boot process. It ensures that the CPU begins executing the main BIOS code at the correct entry point for tasks such as POST (Power-On Self-Test), hardware initialization, and ultimately, the loading of the operating system.

  In summary, the CPU may initially execute some preliminary instructions in the BIOS firmware, and then the BIOS manages the transition to the main entry point for its core operations by adjusting the IP register to the correct address.

  However, accessing code and data from a ROM chip is relatively slow compared to accessing it from RAM (Random Access Memory), which is much faster. To optimize performance, the firmware typically loads parts of itself into RAM during the boot process.

  Here's how the transition from ROM to RAM works:

  - #### ROM Execution:

    When you power on or reset the computer, the CPU begins executing code from a predefined memory location, which points to the initial instructions stored in the ROM chip (e.g., the BIOS or UEFI firmware).

  - #### Firmware Initialization:

    The initial code in the ROM chip initializes and configures various hardware components, including the CPU itself.

  - #### Loading into RAM:

    Part of the firmware's initialization process involves copying portions of itself from the ROM chip into RAM. This is done to improve performance, as RAM is faster than ROM for code execution.

  - #### Continued Execution:

    Once the firmware code is in RAM, the CPU continues executing instructions from RAM. The code in RAM is responsible for carrying out tasks such as hardware detection, configuring system components, and eventually loading the operating system.
